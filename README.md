A Python version of A* method for pathfinding in a grid-based environment may be found in this repository. The program avoids barriers and determines the shortest path between two places.

Verify that the necessary dependencies are installed on your system: 

Matplotlib, opencv-python, and numpy 

Python's OpenCV 
You will be prompted by the script to provide the pathfinding algorithm's initial and final coordinates, Initial Orientation, Final X and Y Coordinates, Final Orientation, 

Make sure the starting and ending coordinates do not cross over with any obstructions and are contained inside the grid borders. 

I used the following code starting values: X:400 Y:200 
Final Numbers: X = 850 Y = 50 
clearance value =5
stepsize =6

The shortest path between the starting and finishing coordinates will be displayed in a visualization of the pathfinding process created by the script.
